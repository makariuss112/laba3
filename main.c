/*
    Task:

    1. Find and print the 2 most significant bits of an unsigned integer.
    2. A structure contains information about company employees:
       - department code (integer)
       - surname (pointer)
       - nested structure (date of employment) â€“ a fixed-length string
       - salary (an integer)

       Requirements:
         - Find employees with a given surname.
         - Remove (delete) employees whose salary is below a given threshold.

    Additional requirements:
    1) For Task #1, use bit fields; the data is entered from the keyboard.
    2) For Task #2, declare a dynamic array of structures in main, check the memory allocation and free it at the end of the program.
    3) For Task #2, write functions to input and output the first two fields of the structure.
    4) For Task #2, write a function to search in the array of structures by a given parameter (surname).
    5) For Task #2, write a function to remove structures from the array by a given parameter (salary).
    6) Implement a menu to manage the array of structures and perform all necessary data checks.
